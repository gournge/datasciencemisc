# Question 2

Question 2: I have a univariate linear model of $X$ and $Y$, both $n \times 1$ column vectors. Describe what happens when I try to estimate this model with an exact copy of $X$ added as a second exogenous variable, and why, as rigorously and completely as you can.

Univariate linear model means that I have only one parameter $\beta_1$ to estimate. Adding an *exogenous variable* is simply adding another parameter $\beta_2$ to be estimated. So now the regression model looks like this:
