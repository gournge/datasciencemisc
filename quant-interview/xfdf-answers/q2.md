# Question 2

[All questions](/quant-interview/README.md)

Question 2: I have a univariate linear model of $X$ and $Y$, both $n \times 1$ column vectors. Describe what happens when I try to estimate this model with an exact copy of $X$ added as a second exogenous variable, and why, as rigorously and completely as you can.

---

Univariate linear model means that I have only one parameter $\beta_1$ to estimate. Adding an *exogenous variable* is simply adding another parameter $\beta_2$ to be estimated. So now the regression model looks like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2+2&=4\\\
3 &= 2 \times 3
\end{aligned}
\\
\\
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 & 0 \\
a_2 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
